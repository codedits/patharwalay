# Performance Optimizations Applied

## Image Loading Optimizations

### Hero Component
- ✅ Added `fetchPriority="high"` for above-the-fold hero images
- ✅ Set `priority={true}` for critical hero images
- ✅ Optimized `sizes` attribute for responsive loading
- ✅ Enhanced blur placeholder with proper dimensions

### Showcase Component
- ✅ First showcase image uses `fetchPriority="high"` and `priority={true}`
- ✅ Subsequent images use `loading="lazy"`
- ✅ Optimized `sizes` for full-bleed images
- ✅ Added hover scale transitions for better UX

### Product Cards
- ✅ Optimized `sizes` attribute: `(max-width: 640px) 100vw, (max-width: 1024px) 50vw, 25vw`
- ✅ Added `loading="lazy"` for below-the-fold product images
- ✅ Enhanced hover effects with scale transforms

### Product Detail Pages
- ✅ Main product image uses `fetchPriority="high"` when it's the first image
- ✅ Thumbnail images use `loading="lazy"`
- ✅ Optimized image dimensions and transforms
- ✅ Enhanced image preloading for adjacent carousel images

## Navigation Performance

### DNS & Connection Optimization
- ✅ Added `preconnect` to Cloudinary CDN
- ✅ Added `preconnect` to Unsplash CDN
- ✅ Added `dns-prefetch` for Google Fonts

### Route Prefetching
- ✅ Added hover prefetching for navigation links in desktop menu
- ✅ Added hover prefetching for mobile menu links
- ✅ Prefetch key API endpoints and pages in layout

### Menu Performance
- ✅ Off-canvas mobile menu with smooth slide animations
- ✅ Body scroll locking when menu is open
- ✅ Optimized mount/unmount lifecycle for smooth transitions

## API & Database Performance

### Previously Applied (from earlier optimization)
- ✅ Lazy-loaded Cloudinary SDK in API routes
- ✅ Added caching headers to settings API (`s-maxage=60`)
- ✅ Parallelized database queries on homepage
- ✅ Changed `dynamic="force-dynamic"` to `dynamic="auto"` where appropriate

## Resource Loading Strategy

### Critical Resources (Above-the-fold)
```typescript
{
  priority: true,
  fetchPriority: "high",
  placeholder: "blur"
}
```

### Below-the-fold Resources
```typescript
{
  loading: "lazy",
  placeholder: "blur",
  fetchPriority: "low" // where applicable
}
```

### Image Sizes Configuration
- **Full-bleed images**: `(max-width: 640px) 100vw, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 100vw`
- **Product cards**: `(max-width: 640px) 100vw, (max-width: 1024px) 50vw, 25vw`
- **Product detail**: `(max-width: 768px) 100vw, (max-width: 1024px) 50vw, 600px`

## Expected Performance Gains

1. **Faster Initial Load**: Hero and showcase images load with high priority
2. **Reduced Network Waterfalls**: Preconnect and DNS prefetch prevent connection delays
3. **Smoother Navigation**: Route prefetching on hover
4. **Optimized Bandwidth**: Responsive image sizes prevent over-fetching
5. **Better Mobile Experience**: Lazy loading for off-screen content
6. **Faster API Responses**: Caching headers and optimized database queries

## Verification

Run these commands to verify optimizations:

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Start in production mode
npm start

# Test with Lighthouse or PageSpeed Insights
# Check Network tab for:
# - Preconnect headers working
# - Images loading with correct sizes
# - API responses using cache headers
```

## Next Steps (Optional)

- Add service worker for offline caching
- Implement intersection observer for even more granular lazy loading
- Add image compression/optimization pipeline
- Consider using `experimental_ppr` for partial prerendering
